"""
rtcmpoller.py

This example illustrates a simple implementation of a
'pseudo-concurrent' threaded RTCMMessage streaming utility.

(NB: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not truly concurrent.)

It connects to the receiver's serial port and sets up a
RTCMReader read thread.
